# Supervised_Model_Project

Second Project of AI Core. <br>
In this project we look at different classification models and see which one performs better. Additionally, we look for potential stakeholders that can benefit from our idea <br>
The scope of the project falls in line with the one in the Data Pipeline project, where the collected data is meant to predict the result of a football match (Win, Lose, or Draw). The data collection has not been finished yet, so to this day (17/02/2021), the classification models will have less features than the final model. More features and function will be added as the data collection progresses. <br>
In addition to the models, this project looks at the scope of the data, so it sees if there should be a model for each country, or just one model for all countries. The former idea might decrease bias, but leads to fewer samples. <br>

## Data cleaning and Feature Engineering

Before using the data as input, it has to be cleaned, and for improving the accuracy, some feature engineering can be applied. Thus, the first part of this project consists on cleaning the data and extracting new features that can potentially increase the accuracy of the model
